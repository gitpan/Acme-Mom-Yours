Acme::Mom::Yours - Your mom is so fat she takes 2 months to compile

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is intended to demonstrate a CPAN distribution with a
dependency chain significantly larger than even the largest legitimate
application, but not SO large that it would be impossible to install.

This module was created with a dependency on all the major Perl
applications that form the CPANTS Heavy 100 index. This is currently:
