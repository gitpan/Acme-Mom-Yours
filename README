NAME
    Acme::Mom::Yours - Your mom is so fat she takes 2 months to compile

DESCRIPTION
    This module is intended to demonstrate a CPAN distribution with a
    dependency chain significantly larger than even the largest legitimate
    application, but not SO large that it would be impossible to install.

    This module was created with a dependency on all the major Perl
    applications that form the CPANTS Heavy 100 index. This is currently:

    MojoMojo

    Task::Catalyst::Tutorial

    Task-Email-PEP-All

    Parley

    Foorum

    Angerwhale

    CommitBit

    Jifty

    Reaction

    Buscador

    Task::CatInABox

    App::CamelPKI

    Task::SOSA

    App::HistHub

    Test::Apocalypse

    Devel::ebug::HTTP

    Padre

    Pod::Browser

    Titanium

    Handel

    ... and more
